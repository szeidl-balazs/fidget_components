# Fidget Components

## Story

Did you know that you can be a master not just in clothing but in component styling?
You can create your own components with the "clothing" you dreamed of.

Did you work with React?
Do the default button tag bore you to death?
Do you feel stressed out in programming?
If yes, it's the right time to create something Ã  la mode and something that make you feel relaxed.

I am sure that you heard about [fidget cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidget_Cube).
And I know that the only thing you are dreamed of is to click buttons and raise-decrease counters for no reasons.
Let's create our own online fidget page where we can reduce our stress level!

## What are you going to learn?

- Styled components

## Tasks

1. We need something to urround our fidgets.
    - There is grid in the middle of the page outstanding from the background
    - The grid has 2 tiles

2. We want 5 buttons having interactions with the mouse.
    - There are 5 buttons in the first tile of the grid
    - Every button has a different default color
    - When we hover over one of the button, it scales bigger and scales back when the mouse leaves its place
    - When we click on a button, it changes its color randomly

3. Create a counter we can raise or decrease its number.
    - There is a number, a `+` sign and a `-` sign in the second tile of the grid
    - The default number is 0
    - When we click on the `+` sign the number grows and decrease if the `-` sign is clicked

## General requirements

- All the components are made by styled-components

## Hints

- If you are not that creative or you're just not that guy who likes to play with CSS properties, learn about MaterialUI, the react components' bootrstrap.
